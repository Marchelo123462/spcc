            <h1>My Growing Pain</h1>
            <p>[1. One thing I struggled with most during coding was how to connect to github. I keepforgot the process but now I already remember it.
                2. When my code did not work, I usually search online, ask chatgpt, or ask teacher.
                3. Wireframing felt easier than coding because it do not need to remember lots of code. Also do not need to use much brian.
                4. One thing I learned about myself while learning to code is code is too hard. And mymemory is very bad.</p>
            <h2>When you say it's hard to memorize codes, but have you thought that maybe you aren't trying to memorize codes the right way?</h2>
            <p>Yea, maybe I will keep try other ways to memorize.</p>
